	<h3>Lemonade is a sweetened lemon-flavored beverage. </h3>
	<p align="left">There are varieties of lemonade found throughout the world.[1] In North America and South Asia, cloudy lemonade dominates. It is traditionally a homemade drink using lemon juice, water, and a sweetener such as cane sugar, simple syrup or honey.[2] In the United Kingdom and Australia, clear lemonade, a carbonated drink, is more common.[3][self-published source?] Despite the differences between the drinks, each is known simply as "lemonade" in countries where it is dominant.[3]</p>

	<h3>Cloudy lemonade</h3>
	<p align="center">The predominant form of lemonade found in the US, <strong>Canada</strong>, and India, cloudy lemonade, also known as traditional or old fashioned lemonade in the UK and Australia, is typically non-carbonated and made with fresh lemon juice; however, commercially produced varieties are also available. Generally served cold, cloudy lemonade may also be served hot as a remedy for congestion and sore throats,[9] frozen, or used as a mixer. <br>
	Traditionally, children in US and Canadian neighborhoods start lemonade stands to make money during the summer months. The concept has become iconic of youthful summertime Americana to the degree that parodies and variations on the concept exist across media. References can be found in comics and cartoons such as Peanuts, and the 1979 computer game Lemonade Stand.[10]</p>

	<h3 id="pink-block">Pink lemonade</h3>
	<p align="justify">A popular variation of cloudy lemonade, <span style="color:red">pink lemonade</span>, is created by adding additional fruit juices, flavors, or food coloring to the recipe. Most store-bought pink lemonade is simply colored with concentrated grape juice or dyes.[11]<br>
	A 1912 obituary credited the invention of pink lemonade to circus worker Henry E. "Sanchez" Allott, saying he had dropped in red cinnamon candies by mistake.[12]<br>
	Another origin story credits another circus worker, Pete Conklin, in 1857. His brother George Conklin tells the story in his 1921 memoir. According to the story, Conklin's lemonade was a mixture of water, sugar and tartaric acid, with the tub garnished with a single lemon that he repeatedly used for the season. One day, he ran out of water. Searching desperately, he found a tub of water a bareback rider had recently used to rinse her pink tights. Adding in the sugar, acid and remaining bits of lemon, he offered the resulting mixture as "strawberry lemonade" and saw his sales double.[11][13]</p>
